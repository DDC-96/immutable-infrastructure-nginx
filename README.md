Deploy Nginx Using Packer, Ansible, and Terraform in AWS — with Bash Script

Immutable Infrastructure 
is an operational strategy where servers, VMs, or containers are never updated in-place after deployment, 
instead they are replaced with a new build. Some benefits include elimination of configuration drift, 
consistency among environments (i.e. development, staging, and production), 
reliable rollback strategy, and simplified horizontal autoscaling.
